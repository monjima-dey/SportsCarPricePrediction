# SportsCarPricePrediction

A regression-based machine learning model for predicting sports car prices.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of sports cars based on various features such as brand, engine capacity, horsepower, mileage, and other relevant attributes. Using regression techniques, the model learns from historical car price data to provide accurate estimations for future listings.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset for training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful insights from raw data.
- **Model Training:** Applies regression techniques to build a predictive model.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization:** Generates plots to understand relationships between variables.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed and the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SportsCarPricePrediction.git
